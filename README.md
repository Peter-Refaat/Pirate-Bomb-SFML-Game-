# SFML Game Project

This project is a game developed using SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) as part of my first-year college coursework in **Structured Programming** at the Faculty of Computers and Information Sciences - Ain Shams University. It was an exciting introduction to programming, where I applied foundational concepts in C++ and Physics to create a fun and interactive game.

## Project Overview

- **Language**: C++
- **Graphics Library**: SFML
- **Development Environment**: Visual Studio Community

### Features

- Real-time graphics and animations using SFML.
- Simple gameplay mechanics that demonstrate the use of structured programming principles such as:
  - Control structures (loops, conditionals).
  - Functions.
  - Structs.

### Installation

To play the game, just clone the repo to your computer and enjoy!
